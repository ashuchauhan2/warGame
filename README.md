# warGame (work in progress)

Java based game being built for a school assignment. Game is similar to mobile war games such as Clash of Clans.

Game will include a Village Hall, attacking features, an army, 3 different resources, and mines for each of these resources, workers, and defences to guard the village.

Potentially will include a GUI for the game at a later time.
